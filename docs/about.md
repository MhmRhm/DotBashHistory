Hey there, I'm Mohammad Rahimi, a Senior C++ Developer. I've been coding for
over 10 years, mainly focusing on real-time high-throughput and distributed
applications in the communication industry. Currently, I'm working on protocol
analyzers and the upcoming USB4 Gen4.

My background? I studied Electrical Engineering and hold a Master's degree in
Control and Instrumentation. I'm really passionate about robotics and
programming.

Throughout my journey, I've gathered a few techniques and some experience that
I'm excited to share with you on this website. I hope you find them useful!

Oh, and if you happen to be in Kuala Lumpur and fancy a game of pool ðŸŽ±, let's
meet up for a match!
