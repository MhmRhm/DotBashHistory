## Preface

We already know the most common Git commands from
[Part 1]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-05-08-eat-git-part-1.md %}) and
have explored Git's internals in
[Part 2]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-05-15-eat-git-part-2.md %}). In
[Part 3]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-05-19-eat-git-part-3.md %}), we
learned about additional tools that a single developer can benefit from. Here in
Part 4, we will see how all our knowledge about patch files, commits, and
branches come together, enabling a team of developers to work together
coherently.

We'll start by explaining what remotes are. Then, I will introduce some useful
commands for managing local and remote branches. After that, we'll get to the
most important part of this tutorial: sharing work and resolving conflicts.
