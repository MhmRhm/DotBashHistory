## Preface

In [Part 1]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-05-08-eat-git-part-1.md %}),
we covered the main commands of Git, so now we know how to make a commit. In
this part, weâ€™ll take a look behind the scenes and create a commit using Git
plumbing commands. Git commands are divided into two sets: Porcelain and
Plumbing. Porcelain commands are the ones you use for everyday tasks, while
Plumbing commands are the lower-level commands that Git combines to perform higher-level tasks.
